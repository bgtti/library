This 'Book Library' enables the user to keep track of books the user has read, is reading, or wants to read.
The user is able to set up a book table, add new items, edit them and delete them.

The purpose of the project was to use contructor functions, built using html, css, and vanilla JavaScript.

The Book Library is part of the Odin Project assignment. For more information about the guidelines, please refer to: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript/courses/javascript/lessons/library
